# SQL

Using publically available data I created a database to house information about the Detroit Red Wing's 2007-2008 season. Seperate tables were made to house demographic information about the players, statistics for skaters, statistics for goalies, the teams's play-off record, and their opponents. 

The pdf file called `VerHulst final project` details the creation of the database as well as a list of commands used to create the databse.
